# MyFirstWeb
 A responsive front end webpage done with HTML and CSS. This is the first web I've developed.

## Aditional Resources Used

 Box Model,
 Responsively

## Goal
To show my ability for design and start getting familiar with coding and some of the resources available. I wanted a webpage that was responsive, attractive and with  great SEO and performance.

## Use of Spanish
 Apologies for the use of Spanish in labels, comments and the UI of the webpage. I might update all to English, I'm not sure if it's worth the time yet. 
 My Future projects will be in English from the get go.
